        <h1 align="center" style="background-color:black text-wrapped;color:red"><u>Properties Of Object Oriented Programming System</u></h1>
       
            
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">1. <u>Class:-</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">Class is a group of member and member function i.e. called class.A class is ablue print of any object. A class is nothing whenever we cannot create its object.</p>
        
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">2. <u>Object</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">An object is an instance or part of class. object is created by 'new' keyword or same name of class with 'new' keyword.When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.</p>
       
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">3. <u>Inheritance</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">Inheritance is used to access one class property with another class there we used inheritance. Classes can reuse code from other classes. inheritance is used by 'extends' keyword. there are three types of inheritance : <br><br>(1).Single Inheritance<br>(2).Multilevel Inheritance<br>(3).Multiple Inheritance</p>
        
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">4. <u>Polymorphism</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">Polymorphism is used to create a 'Many Forms' to completed any applicaions there we used Polymorphism. Polymorphism means 'Many Forms' and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.<br>There are two types of Polymorphism : <br><br>(1).Method Overloading<br>(2).Method Overriding</p>
       
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">5. <u>Abstraction</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. Itâ€™s used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.</p>
    
            <h2 style="margin-left:8%">6. <u>Encapsulation</u></h2>
            <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:justify;margin-left:15%">Encapsulation is a process where internal data is hide,only external data is visible there we used encapsulation. encapsulation is used to wrapped data in a single object there we used encapsulation. The wrapping up data and methods into a single unit called class is known as encapsulation.</p>
